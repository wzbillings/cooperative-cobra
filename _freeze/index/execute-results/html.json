Hopefully the\nnavbar above will get you where you need to go. Right now, there's not\nmuch else I can think of to add on this place (probably a directory of\nprojects once there's more to show), so I've included the same basic information\nyou'd find on the main GitHub page.\n\n---\nformat: gfm\n---\n\n<!-- README.md is generated from README.qmd. Please edit that file instead. -->\n\n\n\n# Pytorch test\n\n<!-- badges: start -->\n<!-- badges: end -->\n\n### 🤝🐍: Note on \"cooperative cobra\" project name\n\nI wasn't sure what to name this project or what it would be about, only that\nI wanted to learn Pytorch. So I used [**codename**](https://svmiller.com/codename/)\nto generate an  [Ubuntu-style](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DevelopmentCodeNames)\nworking name for the project.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(codename)\ncodename_message()\n#> code name generated by {codename} v.0.4.0\n\ncodename(seed = 31034987, type = \"ubuntu\")\n#> [1] \"cooperative cobra\"\n```\n:::\n\n## Licenses\n\n**Text and figures:** all text and images I create in this repository are\nlicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International\nLicense, [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\n\n**Code:** all code created by me is licensed under the GNU Affero General\nPublic License, [AGPL 3.0](LICENSE.md).\n\n## Contributions and Contact Info\n\nAs this is a learning experience for me, I currently do not intend to accept\ncontributions.
