### 🤝🐍: Note on “cooperative cobra” project name

I wasn’t sure what to name this project or what it would be about, only
that I wanted to learn Pytorch. So I used
[**codename**](https://svmiller.com/codename/) to generate an
[Ubuntu-style](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DevelopmentCodeNames) working
name for the project.

``` r
library(codename)
codename_message()
#> code name generated by {codename} v.0.4.0

codename(seed = 31034987, type = "ubuntu")
#> [1] "cooperative cobra"
```
