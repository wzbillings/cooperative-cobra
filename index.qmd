Welcome! If you wanted to see my notes or projects where I learned about
Pytorch for the first time, you're in the right place! Hopefully the
navbar above will get you where you need to go.

In order to learn Pytorch, I decided to follow along with this
[free 6 hour course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/free-deep-learning-with-pytorch-live-course/)
offered by `freeCodeCamp`. I also considered their
[26 hour course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-pytorch-for-deep-learning-in-day/),
but my goal was to learn Pytorch in a few days so I could put it on an
internship application. Maybe when I have 26 spare hours (hahahahahaha) I'll
go back and see what I can learn from that one as well.

Right now, there's not
much else I can think of to add on this place (probably a directory of
projects once there's more to show), so I've included the same basic information
you'd find on the main GitHub page.
