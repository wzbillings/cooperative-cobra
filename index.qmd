title: "Zane's Pytorch Adventure"
---

Welcome! If you wanted to see my notes or projects where I learned about
Pytorch for the first time, you're in the right place! Hopefully the
navbar above will get you where you need to go. Right now, there's not
much else I can think of to add on this place (probably a directory of
projects once there's more to show), so I've included the same basic information
you'd find on the main GitHub page.
